Python CLI for AWS Route53


## Why

Having a crack at a Python based CLI utilising boto3 for AWS Route53


## But Really, Why?

I'm fully aware there are other tools out there e.g. AWS Dashboard, [saws](https://github.com/donnemartin/saws) (which is awesome by the way) but this is more of a learning excercise than anything else.
